Automatic Attendance Taker using Tkinter
This project is an Automatic Attendance Taker built using Tkinter, a Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The application simplifies the process of taking attendance by automatically recording the presence of individuals based on user input.

Project Overview
The Automatic Attendance Taker application provides a simple interface to manage and record attendance for a class or meeting. The application is designed to:

Allow users to enter participant names: Users can add participant names to the system.
Mark attendance: Users can select from a list of participants to mark their attendance for the session.
Display attendance records: The system will show the attendance for the current session.
The GUI application uses Tkinter for the interface, providing buttons, entry fields, and a listbox to interact with the attendance system.

Key Features
Participant Name Input: Users can input the names of participants into the system.
Attendance Marking: Attendance is marked by selecting participants from a list.
Attendance Display: The system displays a list of participants along with their attendance status for the session.
Simple Interface: A clean and easy-to-use interface built using Tkinter widgets.
Technologies Used
Tkinter: For creating the GUI.
Python: The core programming language.
Pandas (optional, for advanced features): Could be used to save and load attendance data in a more structured format (e.g., CSV files).
